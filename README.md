# Reinforcement Learning

Small projects to delve into reinforcement learning. Following Sutton & Barto's Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction.

1. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
2. Run the random search algorithm on the CartPole environment. Works well due to the simplicity of the environment: Only 2 possible actions and 4 state parameters to consider.
